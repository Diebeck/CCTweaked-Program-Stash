### AI Installer
Installs AIlink.lua, a program that listens to a pastebin page (https://pastebin.com/XDXyGBBW) and runs any commands on it, so that remote connection is possible. Could be repurposed, but I don't care that much.

wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Diebeck/Cool-Programs-for-CC-Tweaked/refs/heads/main/AIinstaller.lua
```

### BSTOR
A very versatile program for turtles to explore and interact with the world.
